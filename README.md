## How to Contribute?
Join our Community Slack, or choose what interests you:

#### Developer
Developers are the heart of software and to keep TAIP beating we need all the help we can get. If you're looking to code in NodeJS or Golang then TAIP is the project for you! We use React Native and there is even some Kotlin/Objective-C too!

#### Community Management
Metcalfe's law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system - without community blockchain and TAIP is meaningless. We're looking to create a positive, fun environment to explore new ideas, experiment and grow the TAIP's community. Building a community takes a lot of work, but the people you'll meet and long lasting relationships you'll form makes it all worthwhile.

#### Specification / Documentation
Developers & Designers need guidance and it all starts from documentation and specifications. Our software is only as good as its documentation.

#### Testers
It's bug hunting season! TAIP is currently in Alpha and help us submit bug reports, or start browsing our Github Issues. Every bug you find brings TAIP closer to stable, usable software for everyone to enjoy!

#### Translations
Our goal is to make TAIP available to everyone. If you'd like to help us make this multi-lingual it's be greatly appreciated, please ask us about it on Slack.
